# React Web Development Basics

This project focuses on building a React-based front-end, working with mockups, interacting with REST APIs, and optimizing website performance.

## Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Implementing Mockups (HTML/CSS)**:
   - Use provided mockups from Figma: [Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/file/ykJhQGVFGbQBEQZzuktwvm/TESTTASK---2022?type=design&node-id=3373-30897&mode=design&t=4ceeXNk25tPUKZ87-0).
   - Create a single-page layout with a minimal set of styles and components.

2. **Interacting with a REST API (GET)**:
   - Implement a block for displaying data from a GET request following the mockup and API documentation.
   - Display a list of six users, sorted by registration date (newest first).
   - API Documentation: [OpenAPI Documentation](https://apidocs.abz.dev/test_assignment_for_frontend_developer_api_documentation#).

3. **Handling REST API (POST) Requests - Registration Form**:
   - Create a registration form with front-end validation and business logic according to the mockups and API requirements.
   - Upon successful registration, refresh and display updated user data in the GET request section.
   - If the "Show more" button was previously clicked, collapse and display only the first page of results.

4. **Website Optimization (Bonus)**:
   - Optimize CSS, JS, images, and other resources to improve performance.
   - Deploy on a hosting platform and share the domain.
   - Ensure the following performance checks:
     - **Google Page Speed**: Achieve a score in the green zone.
     - **Google Chrome Performance Audit / Lighthouse**: Meet performance, best practices, and SEO criteria (for both mobile and desktop on 3G).
     - **Webpagetest**: Aim for high performance scores.
